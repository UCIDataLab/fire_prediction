# fire_prediction
We're using satellite data to predict the spread of forest fires, particularly in Alaska. Initially we're exploring just the forest fire
data, which comes from NASA's MODIS satellites. We are in the process of adding weather data from NOAA's GFS, and maybe elevation, roads,
and rivers eventually.

Currently this project is broken up into a couple directories:
* carpentry: converting raw data into more usable formats
* exploratory: ipython notebooks that explore the data to see what exactly we can do with it
* pics: pretty pictures generated from exploratory data analysis.
